## 2. Project Summary
### Device Description  
Our project is an IOT automatic beverage machine called Drink God. The device is based on the SAMD25 microcontroller and the WINC1500 Wi-Fi Chip. The device can be selected on the mobile device to get the desired drink. The Drink God contains distance sensors to ensure that the drink poured into the glass does not overflow. In addition, Drink God also contains temperature sensors to detect the current temperature of the environment to determine whether you need to add ice to your drink to ensure that you enjoy your drink at the most suitable temperature. At the same time, Node-red Interactive Interface will show the name of the beverage you are currently drinking and the number of times you have drunk various beverages in a short period of time. The device could make it easier for people to choose what they want to drink. The use of Internet connection in this device can make this product more intelligent. After using the Internet connection, people can observe their drinking habits on the mobile device, so people can combine the recorded data to improve their drinking habits and make their life more healthy.  
### Inspiration  
In daily life, people need to drink water or beverages every day. Motivated by the idea of wanting to realize a more convenient way to get drinks while keeping track of one's drinking habits, this project was started.  
### Device Functionality  
The project is underpinned by a suite of sensors and actuators that create a complex hardware component for drink god. An ultrasonic distance sensor was used to monitor the height of the drink level and prevent spillage. A temperature sensor is used to monitor the temperature of the drink to determine whether ice should be added to ensure that the drink is at the optimal serving temperature. The SAMD25 microcontroller acts as the central processing unit of the device, receiving data input from the sensors, as well as data input from the mobile device, managing the operation of the pumps through relays to transfer the drinks, and controlling the servo motors to add ice to the drinks. The Wi-Fi Chip WINC1500 handles the connection to the Wi-Fi network, including the process of searching for, connecting to, and authenticating with the network, receiving control commands from the cell phone, and sending device status to the cell phone. The temperature of the drink, as well as the user's most recent drink is displayed on the UI interface for reference. The project encompasses essential electronic concepts such as timers, interrupts, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), I2C communication.  
### Challenges  
The biggest challenge we encountered in this project was to write drivers for each sensor, because we couldn't use the written libraries directly, we needed to make these sensors work in our own freertos environment, so we needed to refine the .c and .h files for these sensors ourselves.  
In order to overcome this problem, we carefully read the datasheet of every sensor we used and also scrutinized the structure of our freertos, and with perseverance, made every sensor work properly.  
### Prototype Learnings  

### Next Steps  
Further enhancements can be realized in several ways:  
1. Advanced User Interface and Experience
Enhanced Mobile App Features: Develop additional features in your app, such as personalized drink recommendations, the ability to save favorite mixes, or schedule drink preparations in advance.
Interactive Feedback System: Implement a feature where users can rate drinks or provide feedback directly through the mobile app or Node-Red interface, which could help in improving drink recipes and user satisfaction.
2. Environmental and Health Features
Eco-Friendly Modes: Introduce more energy-efficient operating modes to minimize the environmental impact.
Health-Conscious Options: Offer settings that adjust recipes according to dietary restrictions or nutritional goals, such as low-sugar or low-calorie options.
3. Market Expansion and Customization
Customizable Skins and Accessories: Offer customizable options for the machineâ€™s exterior design to cater to different aesthetic preferences or kitchen decors.
Expanded Beverage Options: Continuously expand the range of beverage options available, potentially collaborating with beverage companies to offer branded and specialty drinks.
